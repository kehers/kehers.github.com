      <p>The majority of my dev work this month has been on <a href="http://prowork.me/">Prowork</a>. There have been other things I can't mention though. Well, besides CallPolls.</p>

<p><b>Callpolls</b></p>
<p><a href="http://stallls.com/callpolls/">An IVR poll application</a> with a local number. Call in, answer a question. That simple. But it wasn't really about the app. It is an experiment with <a href="http://oonwoye.com/">Oo</a>. Besides <a href="/2013/01/04/online-payment-in-nigeria-the-quiet-session-ii.html">payment</a>, IVR has been another part of tech I have been interested in. I even once <a href="/2012/02/29/experimenting-and-moving-on.html">built a webapp</a> for distributing calls within group members. I think there is a lot of possibilties that can be achieved by making our local numbers more flexible. What if right here, right now, I can set up extensions (the press 1 to do this, press 2 for that things) on my phone? Or automatically forward my sms to a website?</p>

<p><b>Prowork API</b></p>
<p>I've been updating the <a href="http://dev.prowork.me/">Prowork API</a> and adding more methods. Notably, there are methods to <a href="http://dev.prowork.me/push-subscribe">subscribe</a> and <a href="http://dev.prowork.me/push-unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a> to the project activity streams via push. I have also been doing little <a href="/2013/03/22/deconstructing-project-and-collaboration.html">API envagelism</a> and even started a series on the <a href="http://blog.prowork.me/post/46420992101/hacking-prowork-building-a-prowork-android-app-for">Prowork blog</a> about building stuffs on the Prowork API.</p>

<p><b>Prowork Notifications Android App + Source</b></p>
<p>While I work on the Prowork Android App, I stole time to extract the notification part to an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.prowork">app on its own</a>. As part of the Hacking Prowork series, there is a <a href="http://blog.prowork.me/post/46420992101/hacking-prowork-building-a-prowork-android-app-for">tutorial about it</a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html">Google Cloud Messaging</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/kehers/Prowork-Notifications">source is available on Github</a>.</p>

<p><b>Google Play Dev Acc</b></p>
<p>Consequently, I got my <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/v2/">Play Store Dev</a> account. $25. Took just a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>That's pretty it. There are a whole lot of other things I'm on but yet to complete. I'm yet to even touch my RasPi. I have set up the OS though. Let's see how April goes.</p>
