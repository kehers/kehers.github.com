    <p>My daughter turns two in a week. It's been an exhilarating and honestly tasking journey. Parenthood changes you. Every single decision I make now revolves around the family. She also starts preschool on Monday and I anxiously look forward to dropping her off. </p>
    <p>I recently got back to ML/AI after I dropped my lessons because of lack of interesting experiments to work on. Now I have a couple of fun things to use it for both personally and at work. If the personal experiments turn out interesting enough, I will surely share.</p>
    <p>I started redesigning <a href="https://suet.co/">Suet</a> recently. The current focus is going beyond just the analytic feeds to build an intelligence tool that can allow creating user and mail segments based on multiple filters. An example: How many <em class="highlight">password reset mails</em> did we send <em class="highlight">this month</em> to the <em class="highlight">platform: OSX</em>.</p>
    <p>Idea I'm playing with in my head: a different type of social media...I know, I know...but wait...imagine this "now" page as a type of social media. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Depending on your preference, you can only post daily, every 3 days or weekly.</li>
      <li>Only your last post is publicly available. (All your posts are privately available to you as a form of journal)</li>
      <li>Followers/Following available but the numbers are available to only you</li>
      <li>Syndication is available with open web standards like RSS/ATOM</li>
    </ul>
