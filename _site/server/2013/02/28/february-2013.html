      <p>It has been a lazy month. It moved too fast. Oh well, I think it's that many things happened - travelling, presentation and studying some [dev] technologies and standards. So what dev thing have I done? Nothing really new. Just improvements on existing projects.</p>
<p><strong>aarrr.js</strong></p>
<p>We've been receiving requests for some of our [<a href="http://prowork.me/">prowork</a>] metrics. Each time there is a new request different from something already pulled, I will have to mine our dbs (we run on MySQL and Mongo). And damn, Mongo can be interesting when you have to do aggregate functions and those map reduce kicks. Even though we've been able to pull metrics like user growth, demography, corporate adoption, etc, ones like retention ratio, activity channels (web? mobile? an app through the api?) and referrals from users can be crazy. What I have done is to write a [node] JS api that receives calls for acquisition, activation, retention, revenue and referrals - the popular aarrr, and do the necessary sort, filter and grouping. On it is a socket io layer you can plug a simple html dashboard to and see these calls live.</p>
<p>Unfortuantely, I can't make the source available - yet. Hopefully, some time soon.</p>
<p><strong>Prowork</strong></p>
<p>As usual I'm throwing in updates to Prowork. I've had to retouch the mobile web too. There is a lot of things going on. And even more to be done. By the way, <a href="http://blog.prowork.me/post/43976116387/prowork-wins-apps4africa-2012">we won the App4Africa business challenge</a> ;)</p>
<p><strong>New blog</strong></p>
<p>I <a href="/2013/02/20/moved.html">moved</a> my blog from posterous to github pages. I know this current design sucks and all. If I have the chance, I will try make it better. You can get the source here: <a href="http://github.com/kehers/kehers.github.com">http://github.com/kehers/kehers.github.com</a>.</p>
<p>I think that's all I can remember. I did some guitar things and will post videos as soon as I can too.</p>
<p>By the way, my RaspPi came in sometime in the month but I'm yet to do anything on it. I'm still picking up the other hardwares in bits.</p>
