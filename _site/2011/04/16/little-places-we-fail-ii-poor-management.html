      I glanced at my watch impatiently. For some reasons it seemed slow that afternoon. I have been unofficially away from camp for three days now and the calls I have recieved have not been relaxing. Olamide's call the previous day was scary. <br />"Ope, wherever you are, get back to camp now!", she had said. The way she emphasized that 'now', I felt I was in some deep shit already. Before I could even say I'm over a thousand km away, she had dropped the call. Folarin had also urged me to come back to camp as early as possible. Why? He won't explain. But the urgency in his voice was always very deep. <p /> My big neon clock showed 2:45pm. Any minute from now, the calabar flight should be announced. My patience was running out. <p /> I looked at the dude beside me. For the first time in like 20 minutes, he wasn't on call. He caught my eye. I gave him a nod. 'Calabar right?'. He replied yes. Then his phone rang again. 'Dear. We should move anytime from now. So..hmm..', he said to the mouthpiece. I don't know if to envy him or not. This is almost the same thing he had been saying for like the ten times he had picked his call in the last 20 minites. Then they had talked about unnecessary boring things and he'd drop again. Less than 2 minutes later, the phone will ring again. MTN Magic number, I said to myself and smiled. Shortly the dude got up and walked away. <p /> I picked my phone and toyed with it. But I'd rather browse the internet than call. I checked on twitter. I have been doing this for the past long minutes so my timeline seem not to change. I closed the browser, stood up and took a walk to use the toilet. <p /> Long minutes passed beyond 3pm. No Calabar relating announcements; I grew more anxious. My new seat was beside a very pretty young lady. And with her was a pretty kid. She was so carefree and happy. No worries for any past, present or any future. She innocently troubled her mum and an older woman seated opposite. Then she'd raced up and down the lobby. <p /> The voice came on the speakers. I listened attentively. But it was not the Calabar flight. It was Kano's. And it was cancelled. I took a deep breath, rest back and closed my eyes. <p /> Few minutes past 4, the lady beside me stood up and whispered something to the older woman's ears. They all got up, pulled the little kid and made to move away. I caught her eye. <br />'Calabar, right?' <br />She nodded briskly and hurried away. I didn't want to follow just immediately. I watched her move towards the departure exit and settle down there. People started standing up from different angles and move towards the same exit. Am I missing something? I got up too, walked towards the exit and waited. <p /> Aero officials hurried up and down. There was these seriousness in their eyes. Long minutes passed. I toyed with my phone again. There on my twitter timeline was the news of an airforce crash at the Kano airport. Sole casuality, the pilot. They airport needed to be closed. <p /> Soon the officials started organizing people to queues. Why wasn't the flight announced? People rushed to form queues. It was expected. We've been waiting for so long. <p /> A woman called out the old to a seperate queue. She had the lemon apron with Aero on her. Her face was cold; her hand clinching tight a big walkie talkie. The queue was attended to first. As this go on, she called out the nursing and pregnant women to another queue too. I watched everything keenly. I took a seat and relaxed. I have been patient all along. Just a few more minutes patience and that is all. Besides, rushing is not my thing. And despite the many ways I have suffered that, I have never learned. <p /> Soon they started attending to the others. I waited still. People push themselves on the queue. Others like me just sat down and wait. Some others stood just beside the line. When the line thinned out to less than 20, I stood up and joined. Some others joined behind me. Few passengers were let through. Then the rest of us were moved to a side. <p /> The official cleared his throat. He was holding a walkie talkie too, the apron hangng down his short body. <br />"Hmm...sorry...you won't be able to join this plane..." <br />For some seconds, there was this cold silence. People don't seem to understand. I don't too. Then the words started making sense. And suddenly an uproar followed. <br />"Great, so where is the plane we are following?", I asked in midst of the angry noise that now enveloped us. It took a while before we got an answer. Actually, the while was spent calming people down. <p /> The explanation was that the 144 passenger plane that was to go to Calabar had developed a fault in one of the engines. Since the Kano flight was cancelled, the 107 plane was now diverted for Calabar and consequently couldn't accommodate all passengers. <p /> That one of the plane's engine couldn't come up wasn't the biggie. Life as we all know it is always full of sudden surprises. The fail however was that the situation wasn't properly communicated to the customers before hand. But not just that. Why should the criteria for board-worthiness be based on age or nursing? A good management should have gathered together all passengers and communicate the situation to them. With a good incentive, 50% voucher discount for example, I know some people won't mind a reschedule for the next day. Or the whole flight should be cancelled. That way, no discrimination. Why should some people board and the others be left hanging unknowingly? Wife of dude beside me and his kid got on board already. And he is left behind. Go figure his vexation. Sure Aero would have lost some dough cancelling the whole flight. But sometimes, customer satisfaction ranks higher than the money.
