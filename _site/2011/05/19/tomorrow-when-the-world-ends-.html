        Friday, March 20, 2011. 6:30pm.<p />I walked down the road to the main gate. I should be far closed from work but it was just hard leaving the internet. And much harder deleting my facebook and twitter accounts. Some students had exams. I invigilated them for some brief minutes. I didn&#39;t even walk around during the invigilation. I just stood there and considered everyone. The dude beside me was really having difficulties writing anything. He was just fidgeting with his pen, looking left and right nervously. I smiled at him and whispered into his ears, &#39;Why worry? The world is ending tomorrow&#39;. The look on his face was epic. And I could still feel him stare quizzically at me as I sneaked away to the computer room.<p /> The main gate is well over half a km far but I&#39;m deciding to walk to clear my brain. Pheeew, so just like that. All the aspirations, hopes, dreams, hustles, everything. All will be gone just like that. I passed two students talking in low tone, cuddling and smiling. I smiled. They had better get a room. It&#39;s their last night together.<p /> I walked on. Clearing my brain didn&#39;t seem to work. Just like that. Just like that. My brain keeps echoing. There is just so much left undone and many more to think of. I decided to rather enjoy the cool evening breeze and the beauty of the surrounding nature. I took a cab going straight to Marian. But that was all I remembered before sleep crept in. The passenger beside me shook me back to life. The driver seem to be talking to me.<p /> &quot;Where for Marian?&quot;.<br />I looked through the window. I was almost close to Atekong.<br />&quot;Atekong will do&quot;, I answered.<br />&quot;Sorry, I will stop at Firstbank&quot;, I added. &quot;Firstbank&quot;, I replied again.<p /> I met quite a number of people waiting at the ATM by the time I stopped. People like me, I said to myself. Atleast, I&#39;m yet to get the memo there are ATMs in heaven and they spend naira there. I waited patiently. As long as I am withdrawing all the money in my account, I don&#39;t mind. Minutes crawled by. Finally it was my turn. I slotted my Wema Bank card in. Inquiry. But it was only the N500 I used for account opening. I cursed silently. So this is how the world will end with NYSC not paying me. Damn, those idiots! As if they knew the world will end and decided to hold on to my last month&#39;s allowance.<p /> I tried my GTB card. Just a few thousands left in there. It is ok by me. It is not as if I wanna buy a car or build a house before the morning after all. I withdrew all, smiled at the next person in line and bounced away.<p /> The streets were noisy. People everywhere. Then I hear prayers. From other angles religious songs. I glanced at Apples. Cars were fully parked outside. From the mirrors, I could see the place crowded. I ignored and walked on. The next bar down the street was filled as well. Somewhere on the TV I could spot some documentary and interview of a crowd of people sort of. Some of those there at the bar concentrated keenly. Others busy themselves with different bottle colors. I cared less. I moved on. Then stopped under a telecom umbrella to get call card. I got for my MTN and Etisalat. The cards were worth over a thousand.<p /> I dashed across the road to Fresh Fries. Crowded as well but I could still find a place. I placed my laptop bag on the table and went to order. I wasn&#39;t even bothered if it was stolen or not. The girl at the counter didnt seem to be surprised when I ordered a plate of coconut rice with 3 chicken and a juice pack. By the time I settled down and considered the food in my front, I laughed. What was I even thinking?<p /> I fiddled with both phones. Where do I start the calls? My nokia reads over a hundred contacts. My Sony Ericsson, three hundred and eighty eight contacts. Even if it is just to hear an hello, it would take me nearly all the night to go through the contacts. I dropped the phone and <i>sub-mount</i> my meal. I&#39;d rather start with those important to me. Then clear up any difference I&#39;m having with anyone. Mum was the first person on my mind. 2 weeks now since I have been back from home and we have only talked like once or twice. We didn&#39;t say it but we both know we have something against each other. I dialed her number. But what do I tell her? That the world is ending tomorrow and I want to hear her voice one more time? I dropped the call before it could ring. Then I remembered girlfriend. The distance has really been having its toll on her. Since the service thing it is just one argument after another. I had told her I wont be paid for the first 4 months, NYSC hasn&#39;t paid me for the last month and I&#39;m living on edge.<br /> &quot;The calling is gonna drop a bit. But always know I still and will always care a great deal about you&quot;. But to her I was only finding an excuse. And now it is four days since our last quarrel and talk.<p />I called her instead.<br /> &quot;What?!&quot;, was the first thing she welcome me with.<br />I laughed. &quot;Life is too short to quarrel, you know&quot;, I replied her.<br />&quot;Like you care&quot;, and she hissed.<br />I ignored her attitude and smiled back. &quot;You know the world is ending tomorrow. We should rather spend these last moments reminising about the good moments we&#39;ve shared. It is only bad we wont be able to share those moments again.&quot;<br /> She hissed again and dropped the call. I sighed. This is gonna be hard. I would rather call her and mum later in the night. This is not working for now. I ate a bit more and fiddled again with my phones. Then I started making calls. Randomly. Just anyone that crosses my mind. Over half of the calls didn&#39;t go through. The network complaining about being busy. I laughed. People calling people. Then I started sending text messages. And they were funny ones. Doyin&#39;s birthday was to be the next day. My text to her reads, &quot;Happy birthday in arrears. Dont forget to bring my cake to heaven.&quot;. Nife&#39;s is to be on 25. I copied her too and added &quot;too bad, we no go fit do party&quot;.<p /> By the time I got back home, it was just past eight thirty pm. Faith caught me at the gate. &quot;You are late. Go drop your bag. You are giving the exhortation&quot;. I smiled wryly and hurried in. By the time I got back, it was just in time for me to step on the podium. I did, looked at everyone and started laughing. They considered me with this &#39;is this boy alright&#39; look for some minutes and everyone started laughing. Something wet rolled down my cheeks. I ignored it and went on my knees and started singing. Everyone joined in the worship. And this we did till the devotion was over. From there it was straight to bed. I didn&#39;t even consider dinner. My eyes were closed for long but sleep didn&#39;t come. It was like long hours passed. And slowly the surrounding noises, voices and conversation died.<p /> I thought of my life. The so many ways and places I have held back. If there is any regret I have it is that. The people I really loved but never got to tell them; the ones I cared about and never really showed it; the books I promise to write but never started; applications and start-ups I always wanted to do but never get at; the crazy escapades I always shy from. I got up in the darkness. Everyone was fast asleep by now. I found my way via the faint light of my phone. I opened my bag and brought out a note and went through it for the hundredth time.<p /> A week at Rio.<br />A week at Vegas.<br />A month as a volunteer for any program in a country far away.<br />Threesome.<br />Skydiving.<p />I skipped through the rest of the list. None accomplished. I shook my head, shred the note and went back to bed. Then I said a little prayer.<p /> I heard a loud noise. It was as if I had slept for long. I looked around me. No flashing lights. No people rising up in the air to heaven. I felt my watch still on my wrist. I glanced at it. Saturday, 21. 4:55am. Then the noise came again. But it was just Faith with the big bell, waking us up for the morning devotion. Mcheew. The world isn&#39;t coming to an end yet after all.
