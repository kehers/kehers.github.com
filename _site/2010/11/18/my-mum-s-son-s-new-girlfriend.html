        <p>I called my mum that afternoon to check on her as she earlier told me she was travelling to home-town for an occasion. After the usual pleasantaries, she'd joked, "Hey, I've got a girlfriend for you here in my village". Some long days later I was back at home and during one of our jaws I asked of my proposed girlfriend.<p />"Oh Vee<em>*</em>...she is fine I guess. She calls me regularly. In fact I'm starting to feel guilty of not reciprocating her calls".<p />I was kinda startled as I actually thought the girlfriend thing was just another of her jokes.<p />"So...hmmm", I started, wondering what to really ask. "Tell me about her".<br />"She was an usher at the occassion. She was just been so friendly to me and I told her I will give her to my son". One of my eyelids twished. "Of course that was a joke", she mocked me. "Infact she schools in Akungba, same school with your girlfriend".<br />"My girlfriend?", I quizzed, now confused.<br />She looked back startled. "Ofcourse the pretty lady her dad is a king in...remind me of her name...D.."<br />"Oh...yeah, yeah", I cut in. For one, my wobbled love life is an area I keep from her. And for two, to me, we can as well end the chapter of Vee. As she said already, the whole 'give to son' thingy is a joke and should stay that way. If for anything, I don't do blind dates. At least not anymore. Where have the 'unblind' ones even led me?<p />And so that was the end - to me. But Vee'd call mum every now and then. And once in a while mum'd return the call. I was getting skeptical about the whole stuff and had once asked mum what her relationship with her is all about.<p />"Don't tell me you are having a think about her".<br />"Me? Think? Her? Mcheeew. I'm just concerned the young lady may be taking the son thing serious".<br />"Ha, no. No. She knows I was joking".<p />But mum was wrong.<p />She'd called one day and I had intercepted the call, for the fun of it, while mum was downstairs.<p />"Hi....",<br />"Good evening ma",<br />"Oh, sorry. Mum is downstairs",<br />"Oh...hi. And who are you?",<br />I hesistated for the fraction of a second. "Name is Opeyemi, her son".<br />"Heeey! Hi...I.."<p />I heard my heart beat increase. "Can you please hold on for some seconds? Lemme get the phone across", I quickly cut in and dropped the call.<p />Next day, her text came in "Can I please come and spend the muslim holiday with you?". When mum showed me, I was like wtf? "I thought you only met this girl once."<br />I guess at that point, mum started knowing she her little joke was taking serious. Problem was now how to change the young lady's mind about it 'politely'. She even had to come up with different excuses to convince Vee of not coming for the holiday. Despite this, she was still probably in town as she sent a text next day saying she is in town and wondering if she could come over.<p />Mum is pissed off already - I definitely made sure of that *evil grin*. I mean how can a girl be so....[what's the adjective here?]. Mum must be trying so hard not to hurt her. I've even came up with some very funny lines I would have used if in her shoes.<p />"Hey Vee, I was just joking about the son thing..." but then the girl would have been like "Son? Did I mention anything about interest in your son? I only wanted to see you...". or something like "Joking? Are you kidding me? Didnt you know that in the first place?". I laughed when I thought of it. I thought of other lines too and concluded the best line would be "Can you please f* off!". Then I thought of that too and laughed and laughed and laughed. That will be just so annoying. And mum will not, never, do that.<p />Well she still continues to disturb mum. And my business? None! Thank God it's mums number she has. I've got 99 problems already and a stalker aren't one of them :-P Just yesterday, she sent her account number saying mum should send her 'some holiday goodies'. I laughed my a** off when I saw the text. Mum was the one that made the expensive joke. She should as well deal with it.</p>
