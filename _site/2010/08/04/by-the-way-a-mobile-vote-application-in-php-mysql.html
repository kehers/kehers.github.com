<p>So, here is a quick one I had to jell together for a friend of a friend within some hours. It is the guy's project at school and I call it <strong>MoVo</strong>. I actually mean that to mean Mobile Vote Application. Yes, the name doesn't make sense to me too; you know, names can be hard at times. The idea is simple. Have a mobile web application that allows students vote for their choice contestant (for whatever election).</p>
<p>I designed it with&nbsp;xHTML MP (unvalidated),&nbsp;PHP and MySQL. The front page gives admin and student login options. The admin is responsible for registering students&nbsp;and&nbsp;setting up contestants. The student just comes in and vote for his/her choice contestant. And yes, he/she can only vote once :-P</p>
<p>So, simply download, install, and play around with it. Dont forget to setup the database for the application and run the queries in the <em>db.sql</em> file. (You an login into the admin with username and password: <strong>admin</strong>). Also edit the <em>config.php</em> file to your database settings. Point of note though, it is a quickly jelled together thingy and there is still space for a lot of improvements and extensions. It is just as simple as it can get at the moment.</p>
