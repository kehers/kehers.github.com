        <p>Something drew me to my <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account">Twitter settings page</a> (on web) and I noticed I can now request my tweet archive. So I did and within few minutes the download link popped up in my email. I spent the next long minutes, after download, going through the sentences that made up my first tweets. There was an overwhelming nostalgia this brought. I couldn't help but make out a couple of things.</p>
<p><strong>Time is always on the move</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to believe I tweeted some of those things some 5 years ago. Some of them were like yesterday. Morale of this for me is that there is never a "too late" time. If there is anything you need to commit to for long term, do. Before you know it, you are asking how fast time has gone.</p>
<p><strong>An era ends, another begins</strong></p>
<p>It is amazing looking back at the lot of things that were but are no more. <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/2033838735">Wave</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/10944535483916291">Digg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/185239435397439488">Y! Meme</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/1191527062">naijaPulse</a> to mention a few. Personally, I have worked on a lot of things as well. Most of my early tweets were about the now defunct <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/190126995332530176">ngbot</a>. But not only products. <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/1715362990">Relationships</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/1850151041">too</a>. The interesting part? When one ends, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZURB/statuses/124984359135608832">another</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/29299435398">starts</a>. Things may not work out as planned. You may fail somewhere in between. People will leave or change. There is however always a chance to <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/2260613558">start again</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conversations open the world around you</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting to see how my tweets evolved from "soliloquy" to conversation - <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/1161977751">commenting</a> on tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/2582245094">debating ideas</a>, receiving feedbacks, etc. It all seem "ordinary" but a second look, you realize how deeper it can get. Somehow, you start having a different perception of the world around. You understand and <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/78432411913957376">learn more things</a> from others. But it doesn't end there. Sometimes, you build even more real relationships. I have met and worked with a lot of great people through twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/kehers/statuses/10734865752">Franc</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ifeoluwadebo/statuses/51576523676852224">OO</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gbengasesan/statuses/56973389037973504">Gbenga Sesan</a> (even though we haven't met physically), and a lot of others. A real lot. If it can get this great online with people you hardly know at first, think of the endless possiblities conversations can achieve in real life.</p>
<p>It has really been fun going through the old tweets. I got tired and stopped somewhere around 2010. I will probably contine going through the tweets later. You should check to see if you have access to yours already as well.</p>
