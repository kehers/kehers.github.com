      Blame this post on the boredom of a 10hr+ road trip. But really, my twitter follower count is about 400 and I had to break some rules to follow just over half that number. Here are some reasons why. <p /> <strong>1. The noise</strong> <br />I like to read all tweets on my timeline. This means having to follow just a few people with worthy tweets. I use to keep that number to just 140. These days, well, its well over that but I try to reduce the number as much as I can coz really, the lesser the count, the lesser the noise. <p /> <strong>2. I didnt know </strong><br />Gone are the early days I check my follower count at each noticed count increase. These days it's just once in a while. And even then its mostly a quick glimpse and that's all. A lot of follower get attention by asking for a follow back. I prefer engagement. That is, contributing to or sharing a tweet. By the mention, I become easily aware of your presence. <p /> <strong>3. Our differences</strong> <br />So I decide to follow you. The first thing is checking your tweets. Twitter to me is my channel of keeping up with my interests. Then plus gossips, gists, fun and one-liners too. If there is a convergence of interest, I don't care if your tweet or follower count is just 10, it is a go. Not? Well your bio or avatar better do the charm ;) <p /> <strong>4. You retweet to reply?</strong> <br />Really? That just makes my timeline noisy as I get to see tweets that are not my concern. Normal replies (@receiver reply msg) ensures only the receiver and his/her follower gets the tweet. This also keeps the conversation flow. <br />Retweeting to reply has its place though. It's useful when you want the tweet to be visible to everyone. But no, not for every replies. <p /> That's basically it. And if I even still dont follow you, please don't take it personal. Truth is I don't even follow most of my real life best friends on twitter. That's what facebook is for.
