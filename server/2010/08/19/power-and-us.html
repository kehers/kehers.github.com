      <p>This happened some days ago as I board a cab from town to my crib. Along the main market, a husky man had hurriedly waved down the cab. He should be somewhat in his late forties. Or maybe he is not that old and its just his rough look. He is one of those people you'd see and the first thing that comes to your mind is a thug. You know, burnt teeth, pot belly, rough face, some weird dressing and those characteristics.<br />The cabbie stopped and the dude bumped in.<br />'Hey drop me off at Isolo junction', he said arrogantly.<br />'Hope you have <em>change</em> sir', the cabbie replied as he moved.<br />Though I was seated in front and didn't see his expression, I'm sure the dumpty guy must have looked at the cabbie with this big contempt as he replied,<br />'Change? You don't know who I am?'. Really you should hear the tone he voiced that out in.<br />'Sorry, but I dont know who you are sir', the cabbie replied.<br />And again he repeated the 'You mean you don't know who I am?' in this way I had to be sure again I'm not having the governor as a co-passenger.<br />'Sorry, I dont know who you are and that doesnt affect my right to ask if you have change or not', the cabbie replied.<br />'You mean you dont know who I am! Well I dont pay for cab!'.<br />'But Im sorry, I dont know you'.<br />'So you want me to get down? You want MEEEEE to get down?'.<br />'I dont know you and I have the right to, but it's not about that...'.<br />'Hey hey! pull over for me here', he barked at the cabbie before he could finish his sentence.<br />The cabbie pulled off, the man got down, but before we could move some few meters away, some 4 arrongant dudes surrounded the cab. Everything that followed happened like a flash. One got towards the drivers side, yanked open the door and was to probably give the guy some beating of his life, starting with this big punch or slap but fortunately for the cabbie, he happened to be an acquitance.<br />'Oh! It's you! Oh...oh...oh...It just shouldn't have been', the guy that was to do the beating said, hanging his fist in the air.<br />The other guys seem to know him too as another one came close and said, 'Oh...its you'.<br />'But now you have fucked up', the third said.<br />The fourth came to the passenger's side, opened the door and motioned all passengers to come down. 'Go get another cab. This one is in trouble', he said.<br />'You have fucked up! But what will happen now is we will help you beg', the first guy said, and still gave the cabbie that slap on the head.<br />They locked up his cab, and dragged him away towards the dumpty man now walking towards them.<br />You should see the anger on dumpty's face. At that point, if he had a gun, he would most def have shot the cabbie. 'You...you...you disgraced me! A whole me! Saying you don't know me *insert the viliest of curses you've heard here*'. And there I was in a corner watching the whole drama. You are not the president; you are not the governor! Why must every one know you? Even Judas had to kiss Jesus Christ to make him known to the great multitude that came to take him (Mat 26:48). Irrespective of your status, why can't you pay a meagre N20 for your cab fare?<br />The way I've seen we humans misuse power is just so terrible. Those in the higher level of authority straight down to every other person. Just a couple of weeks ago, a so-called professor in my school almost slapped me because he nearly hit a friend on zebra crossing and I tried to correct him. He wasn't even concerned about the fact that he nearly killed someone on the crossing but that a 'mere' student can tell him, a 'whole learned professor', that he is wrong. The one thing we always seem to forget is that power has great destructive abilities. It's the same with fire - great servant, horrible master. I can go on talking about this but the morale of the story is that we should always remember that things never stay the same. The ass you kick today may turn out the one you will kiss tomorrow. That by grace you are in that position today and you have that power, doesn't mean you will tomorrow.<br />Oh, my cab friend? He was finally released after so much of begging dumpty and some kicks from the other thugs. He was lucky anyway. If he hadn't known the other thugs, they would have given him the beating of his life and impound his car for a day or two, simply because he refused a free fare, with his cab.</p>
