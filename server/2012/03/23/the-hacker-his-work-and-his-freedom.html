      <p>Few friends know what I do. A lot of others take me for something else. I told a BBM contact I will be spending the day working with a few friends coming over and when she saw me put up a display picture showing us with laptops later in the evening, she went cynically, "Now I know what you do". I smiled, understanding what she really meant.<p />So what do I do? Really, I don't know. I just toy with systems and codes and someone pays for it. Ok that's a joke. I am a lover of programming and I love to toy around codes as much as I can. Somewhere along these lines, I am able to create one or more things for people to use and I get paid for it. And oh, I have disappointed a whole lot of people as well and have <a href="http://opeyemi.posterous.com/experimenting-and-moving-on">ruined many things I have created</a> too.<p />But. I enjoy what I do and I doubt if any other type of work can bring the [non monetary] satisfaction. So I'd rather not be stuck in doing what I don't enjoying doing. At least for now :)<p />It is not just about the work though. It is about the freedom. Earlier in my university days, I freelanced for an IT company. It was fun. It was a startup like thing. We have these rooms with PCs, stay up late to hack and all that. We are not constrained by time. I don't have to be at work by 8:00am. I don't have to be in suits, ties and big soled black shoes. I don't have to worry about having to spend the next 3 hours in traffic from work back home. Then it got too official. It stopped been fun. We lost the freedom. Too many rigid specifications. There was no space and time to experiment and be creative. And for that same reason I quit doing public coding jobs generally as well. (I use <em>generally</em> here because there has been and will always be few exceptions *laugh simley*). But really, with public jobs, your mind draws more and more to the reward (the pay), and not the fun or creativity. You are on the whims of the client. Sometimes you trade your creativity for their satisfaction.<p />It is 7:45am. I came in from a morning work-out like an hour ago. I am yet to have my bath. I don't even know what to get for breakfast yet. I may not be leaving this room till late in the afternoon. Till then, I have a blackberry mobile app to continue work on, map integration into the java app I made 2 days ago to monitor my morning jogs and possibly write an introduction of Oauth (Chapter 2) for my book <a href="http://10api.posterous.com/">Around the web in 10 (RESTful) APIs</a>.<p />That to me is freedom.</p>
