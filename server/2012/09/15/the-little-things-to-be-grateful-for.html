      <p>Tuesday 11. Came home late to the gist that a snake was sighted in the house. As it was late and we couldn't run any thorough search, I had to go pass the night at a friend's.</p>
<p>Thursday 13. Had a minor bike accident. Sustained few bruises on both legs.</p>
<p>Appetite.<br />The warmth of your bed.<br />Sleeping with both eyes closed.<br />Feeling the rush of wind across your face as you go over 80km/h.<br />Friends.<br />Neighbours.</p>
<p>There are a lot of little things to be grateful for.</p>
<p>And oh, the internet too :)</p>
