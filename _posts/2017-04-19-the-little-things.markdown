Adebayo sent me this:

*Just wanted to say thank you for your book, [Consuming REST APIs](https://gumroad.com/l/Sxoj). I was just going through it again today, and I realised that most of what I know about http requests and responses, REST APIs, and OAuth today started out with your book. That book was a Godsend. I know what it takes me to write an article, so I can imagine the cost to you in time and effort to write a whole bookâ€”and then give it away. I wish I could donate something, but unfortunately, I can't right now. I hope to thank you properly some day. Just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate this work. God bless.*

It's so beautiful when people find what you do useful.
