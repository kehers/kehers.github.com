<blockquote>"...no matter what the proverb tells us, we judge books by their covers. Not only is it much faster than actually having to read the whole thing, but it's what covers are made for in the first place." - <a href="http://twitter.com/sachagreif">@sachagrief</a></blockquote>

<p>Lovely quote I pulled from the article <a href="https://medium.com/p/862d9dbc8d07">Why Dribbble Isn't That Horibbble</a>. It's a very deep one and applies to every aspect of life. Don't just put up a poor appearance and expect people to take time to dig beyond the look. Writing a book? Designing an app? Launching a product? Try put some time into the look and appeal.</p>

<p>Seriously, I need to start taking some design lessons myself.</p>
