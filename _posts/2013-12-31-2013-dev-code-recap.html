<p>Here is my code/development (the ones I remember) related recap of 2013. </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>I <a href="http://kehers.github.io/2013/02/20/moved.html">moved</a> this blog from Posterous to Jekyll on Github pages. The source is available at <a href="https://github.com/kehers/kehers.github.com">github.com/kehers/kehers.github.com</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b><a href="https://github.com/kehers/analytics.php">Analytics.php</a></b><br />
        Wrote a PHP wrapper for <a href="http://segment.io/">segment.io</a> and the awesome guys gave me a "free Segment.io server-side forever" for this. By the way, they now have an official PHP library.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b><a href="https://github.com/kehers/Prowork-Notifications">Prowork Notifications [android] + source</a></b><br />
        Built an android notification app to demonstrate Prowork's push API and use of Google Cloud Messaging. The source is available at <a href="https://github.com/kehers/Prowork-Notifications">github.com/kehers/Prowork-Notifications</a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b><a href="http://blog.prowork.me/post/53190531304/brand-new-prowork-is-coming-june-18">Prowork v3</a></b><br />
        Re-engineered Prowork's task page and some other parts with Backbone js for that realtime effect.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b><a href="http://kehers.github.io/2013/09/30/email-validation-with-mailgun-api-php.html">Email validation with Mailgun API</a></b><br />
        Wrote an email validation class in PHP using Mailgun's API. It does syntax checks (RFC defined grammar), DNS validation, Spell checks (gives you a did you mean suggestion) and Email Service Provider (ESP) specific local-part grammar (if available). It is available at <a href="https://github.com/kehers/MG_Email">github.com/kehers/MG_Email</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I sold <a href="http://twhii.com/">Twhii</a>. I needed to cut out some things. (Or maybe just find new things to waste my time on)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I almost sold <a href="http://stallls.com/">Stallls</a>. The terms were just too hard for me.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b><a href="http://leanpub.com/consumingtheapi">Consuming the API</a></b><br />
        I have always loved how APIs work and have built stuffs on a lot of them. <a href="http://twhii.com/">Twhii</a> is one example I ran for 2 years. I however noticed many developers don't really 'get' APIs. I started a book on API consumption 2012 but wasn't focused on it. When I started working on <a href="https://fonenode.com/">Fonenode</a>, I found the need and picked it up again. It is almost complete now. <a href="http://leanpub.com/consumingtheapi">Kindly subscribe</a> and get notified when it is. Plus I will send you the first sample draft already.

        <p><b><a href="http://birthdays.im/">Birthdays.im</a></b><br />
        An experiment and code example for my upcoming book - <a href="http://leanpub.com/consumingtheapi">Consuming the API</a>. It is a simple sms reminder for birthdays. The app pulls your friends' birthdays from Facebook and sends you daily reminders via SMS. Where it gets interesting is you can query birthdays for a particular day or a person by texting the day or name to a dedicated line. The idea is to show two way SMS interaction using the <a href="https://plivo.com/docs/">Plivo API</a> and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook API</a>. PS: I have disabled the SMS notification now though.

        <p><b><a href="http://fonenode.com/">Fonenode</a></b><br />
        I have been experimenting with telephony for quite a while and did some stuffs with <a href="http://twitter.com/oothenigerian">Oo</a> earlier in the year. We later launched <a href="http://fonenode.com/">Fonenode</a>, <a href="http://www.techcabal.com/fonenode-rolls-toll-free-call-button-websites/">the call button</a>, and I am already working on a new product we have up our sleeves. Do watch this space.
