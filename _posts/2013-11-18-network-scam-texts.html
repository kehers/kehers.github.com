<p>I got the above texts from MTN 2 days ago. In plain term, I will say this is a <b>scam</b>. There is no other word for it. While their numerous other "promo/offer" sms may be forgivable, this is simply not.</p>

<p>The other day, I got this "callertunez" push notification on my phone. It just pops up on my phone screen. This is way different from sms in that I don't even have to reply to get subscribed. All I need is to mistakenly click the wrong button and that is it.</p>
<p>Are these things even right? Even if networks are allowed to spam us with fraudulent texts, shouldn't there be easy opt-out options? Where does <a href="http://ncc.gov.ng">NCC</a> stand in all these?</p>
