<p>Phones are great! Bad news is: they can be unpredictable - data loss, corruption or even loss of the phone itself. <a href="http://mycontactsapp.com">myContacts</a>, however, helps you backup and manage the most important item of your phone - your contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Gotcha, I've got a PC suite!</strong></p>
<p>Don't we all? Well, I do too. In fact two. But then there is just one difference with myContacts - multiple channels to access and manage your contacts - web, mobile (site + app), and directly via the native syncronization feature on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Hmmm...ok, I want in</strong></p>
<p>Great! *Happy smile*. Head out to <a href="http://mycontactsapp.com">mycontactsapp.com</a>, and drop your mobile number. Once we start dishing out the invites, we'll send yours to you via sms.
