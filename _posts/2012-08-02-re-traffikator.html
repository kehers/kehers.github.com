<p>I woke up to this beautiful piece from <a href="http://twitter.com/mrbankole">Bankole</a>: <a href="http://techloy.com/2012/08/02/we-love-gidi-traffic-so-much-that-were-gonna-disrupt-him/">We love Gidi Traffic so much that we're gonna distrupt him</a>. Something about that piece just gave me a sigh of relief. <a href="http://chaostheorycreative.com/RandomCollisions/?p=296">Traffikator</a> is not out, I don't even know the <a href="http://chaostheorycreative.com/">guys behind it</a>, but I love the idea already.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I love <a href="http://twitter.com/gidi_traffic">GidiTraffic</a> too</strong></p>
<p>I don't stay in Lagos. I breeze in every now and then. And even at that, I know how crazy traffic situations can be. Social traffic streams came to solve this. You know them already, you know how they work. And are they solving this problem? I will say they are. Or at least, they are trying. By tweeting crowd-sourced traffic situations, you know what routes to avoid and ones to take. [They tweet more than traffic situations though. I have seen a couple of safety tips among other things].</p>
<p><strong>My (my own) worry</strong></p>
<p>We all have our little daemons. Sometimes, I can really get worried about some little things that are way out of my business. My first question when I noticed one of the traffic stream is who posts this? Really, I was just trying to believe no one will spend a day scouting traffic info and tweeting it. I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>It's 2012 dear</strong></p>
<p>I mean, why will I want to spend all day scouting traffic info in a technology age that people are planning vacation trips out of earth? What happened to technology and automation? I stand to be corrected, but no one human should post over 350 tweets* in a day. Not by 'listening' to traffic situations in the stream, filtering and 'refurbishing'. No, I don't mean the idea. I mean there should be a better way to automate the process.</p>
<p><strong>It can't be that bad</strong></p>
<p>Automating the process can't be impossible. Difficult? Well, let's say complex. But not impossible. Right here, right now, here are two possible ways I just pulled off head:</p>
<ol>
<li>One is to write a simple client that watches twitter's <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/parameters#locations">public stream within Lagos</a> for certain words like <em>traffic</em>, <em>road</em> and related keywords and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/retweet/%3Aid">auto-retweet</a>. If you want to take a step further, you may want to score each tweet based on the number of matched keywords, position in tweet, word weight and so on and put tweets that fall below a score in a pending list you can then personally vet and approve/reject.</li>
<li>In fact, fuck that. Just find a mapping company with traffic details and implement their API. And yes there are. <a href="http://mapit.co.za/">MapIT,</a> which I met at the last Mobile Web West Africa offer similar solution. The guy in charge even demoed it to me.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Oh yes, traffikator</strong></p>
<p>The guys at <a href="http://chaostheorycreative.com/">Chaos Theory</a> think automation should be it as well. They are putting together <a href="http://chaostheorycreative.com/RandomCollisions/?p=296">Traffikator</a>. And even as just an idea I already love it.<p />There are humans, there are bots. We should know where we belong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>* <a href="http://twitter.com/gidi_traffic">@gidi_traffic</a> has been up for 11 months (~330 days) and has over 116k tweets. Do the maths.</em></p>
