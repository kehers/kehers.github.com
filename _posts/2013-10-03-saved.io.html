<p>I found this new bookmark site <a href="http://saved.io/">saved.io</a>. It's very simple and easy to use. You just prefix the url you want to bookmark with saved.io (e.g, <a href="http://saved.io/kehers.github.io/posts.html">saved.io/kehers.github.io/posts.html</a>) and that's all. You can also create lists by adding the list name as a subdomain like this: <a href="http://misc.saved.io/kehers.github.io/posts.html">misc.saved.io/kehers.github.io/posts.html</a>. That adds the url to the list: <em>misc</em>.</p>
<p>One big missing feature though is editing. Most importantly, I want to be able to move my bookmarks between lists. I have sent in a tweet to the <a href="http://twitter.com/savedio">app account</a> and hope that feature gets added.</p>
