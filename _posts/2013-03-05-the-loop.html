<p>For the first time I think she is beautiful. Or maybe it was the lens that made me see her differently - plain, natural. Or maybe because I wanted to. Her eyes were comely - like a little child expecting. Hoping. And again, all my mind could think of was Hadiza.</p>
<p>The shutter made the sound. I didn't even look at the tiny screen of the device. Slowly I drew close to her, starring into her eyes. She wasn't starring at the camera either. Her eyes were into mine. Somehow, we knew what was next.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p>I couldn't remember the last time I was like that. I could feel the flow in my every bone; my every muscle. My blood was racing; my nerves raging. Every thrust, every moan, every whisper resounding in my head. I started hearing voices. Soft voices. I think in my head. But I wasn't so sure. She called my name fully. Slowly. Letting it stretch. Allowing it faint towards the end. Then all I could see was Hadiza. Right there. Her legs wrapped around me. Her lips nibbling my ear. Hadiza 'd call me my pet name - that one only my grannie calls me. It is a native one. And she'd mess up the pronounciation. And even that made it sweeter.</p>
<p>"There.....don't.....yes....don't".</p>
<p>But it wasn't Hadiza.</p>
<p>What exactly went wrong? What did I miss? Did she know from the start? The questions poured. Multi choice answers too. Then my mind lost it. And all went static. She shook violently, clinged to me like she was gonna fall. Nails sank into my back. Then came the descent.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p>We layed close for long. It was probably just few minutes but sure felt long. I didn't stop starring into her eyes. She stared at my chest and drew lines through it.
<p>"Your girlfriend", she said finally catching my eyes.</p>
<p>I didn't even know if it was a question or statement. But I got her.</p>
<p>"I told you already"</p>
<p>I turned and pulled my phone from where it was stuck at the upper end of the bed. I went to the message inbox and showed her the last text from Hadiza. I had acted like a whimp when the breakup struck me. She had gotten furious about that and sent me an annoying text.</p>
<p>I handed the phone to her. Lurking in my sent message were my many text of plea. Some I had composed with eyes full of tears. All begging Hadiza to reconsider; to let's work it out. But I know she won't go beyond the opened sms. She was convinced I had broken up with my girlfriend in the first instance. She didn't need proof. She just wanted me to say it. I could draw up an imaginary smile her face. She handed back the phone. She got hers and punched frantically. Then she showed me.
<p>"We need to talk", she composed.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything. I watched her send it. I still didnt say anyting. She dropped the phone and curled in.</p>
<p>"I love you", she whispered not looking into my eyes.</p>
<p>"You too".</p>
<p>I didn't even know why I said it. But I sure didn't really mean it. Or maybe I do and just don't know it. Her eyes lit up and she looked me in the eyes. She drew close and kissed me passionately. I felt better. It was the first time I felt that way after Hadiza. Then she said she had to leave. A part of me wanted her to stay. Somehow maybe she'd heal me. But I didn't hesitate. Soon dad will be home. I don't want him asking questions about her.</p>
<p>"Boy, I think there are other better things you can do. Why for Christ sake photography?", he had quizzed me the night after my arrival. That has been his fourth time of asking the four times we had met in the last seven months. I didn't answer him. We both know the one outcome of our arguments.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p>Within the five minutes it took us to walk down the street, a number had called her twelve times. I counted it. But she didn't pick up. She told me it is her estranged boyfriend.
<p>"He will never call. I'm the one doing the calling and keeping the relationship alive. Now that I told him we have to talk he is anxious".</p>
<p>"I can't do this anymore. I think I deserve someone who cares about me for once".</p>
<p>I smiled wryly and nodded. I didn't say anything.</p>
<p>She got a bike, gave me a tight hug and left. Moments later, I stood there watching the dust settle behind the trail.</p>
<p>Maybe she is lying. Maybe Hadiza told the other guy the same thing about me. Hadiza told me the guy was just a friend. And that was me two weeks ago, trying to reach her, asking her what I did wrong. Or maybe it's true. Maybe her said lover didn't truly care about her. Maybe the dude loves someone else. And maybe that someone loves someone else. It's like a circle; a loop.</p>
<p>Maybe I will get to love her. I know I will never love her like Hadiza. The instant I met Hadiza, I love her already. But maybe somehow she will make me forget Hadiza. Or time will. Or I will meet someone else who will.</p>
<p>I turned and walked back home. Love is complicated. People who find one mutual and true may never know how lucky they are.</p>
