<p>Had few hours to toy with <a href="http://twhii.com">Twhii</a> tonight and finally decided to push it public. In case you missed the gist, Twhii is an experimental twitter client for java phones. Its still a long way from okay, but it works - you can read your timeline, mentions and tweets, send tweets, reply, quote, retweet, fav, delete and all those. I have shared the developer version with some friends on twitter and basically not much has really changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>No activity indicator in a lot of places. So many times you may not know if the app is working (busy pulling data) or just dozing off. The recommendation here is to be patient for a while when expecting a data pull or so.</li>
<li>High data consumption. The app uses the raw json data from the twitter api. I MAY be introducing a proxy server that will minify data later.</li>
<li>You can't view your sent DM. As I rarely check my sent DMs, this didn't come to my mind in time :/</li>
<li>No new DM. To send a new DM, go Menu-&gt;Tweet: "d recipient_username Dm here" (no quotes though!). You can reply DMs and directly send a DM to a user from a tweet though. (Press your right direction key to see tweet options when on a tweet)</li>
<li>List, Trends and Tags not available.</li>
<li>The rendering attimes get wobbled especially with tweets containing some html entities.</li>
<li>In user profile, the scrolling is still awkward. Will find time to fix that.</li>
<li>The app is optimized for qwerty keypad (I use one :-P). For numeric keypads, turn on liveEdit, go to Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Live Edit. The plus with the application's own editor is username autocomplete. To switch from the applications editor to the phone's native editor, press * for half a minute when in the editor mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those that have tried the developer build, the changes to this build (49) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed oncancel error for 'Find Username'</li>
<li>Save update interval</li>
<li>Tweet not sending if location is set on but not available</li>
</ul>
