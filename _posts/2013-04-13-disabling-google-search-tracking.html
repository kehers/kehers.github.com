<p>Google tracks urls you click in a search result for whatever reasons (I'm guessing ads, search history, custom results et al). And I wouldn't have cared if not for the fact that it ruins my browser history. Well, amongst others.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/image/{{ page.date | date: '%Y/%m' }}/googletrack.png" /></p>
<p>A good work around to this is the tiny shiny userscript <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95092">Google Link Cleanup</a>. To setup (Firefox), simply install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a>, and then <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95092">Google Link Cleanup</a>. That simple.</p>
<p>Well, for me, I have set <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> as my default search engine - again. And if tomorrow, Google search daemons call, Greasemonkey gat my back.</p>
