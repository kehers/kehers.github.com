<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://segment.io/">segment.io</a>, a beautiful app that helps you easily connect to your various analytic platforms. The interesting part for me is using it to track user actions (events) within your application. For integration, Segment.io has a <a href="http://segmentio.github.com/analytics.js/">javascript</a> and NodeJs library. Since there is a <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-rest">REST API</a>, I decided to write a simple PHP server-side library for use in any of my PHP projects.</p>
<p>It is available on github here: <a href="https://github.com/kehers/analytics.php">https://github.com/kehers/analytics.php</a></p>
