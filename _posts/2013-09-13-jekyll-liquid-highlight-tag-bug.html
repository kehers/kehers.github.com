<p>I took a break from writing for a while. And look what I found when I got back - my page stopped building :/</p>
<p>Jekyll will build locally. But once I push to <a href="http://github.com/kehers/kehers.github.com">github</a>, it fails. At first I thought it was a Github ish as I saw similar complaints around the web. It later occured to me it could be the difference in jekyll version, so I updated the gem this morning.</p>
<p>Building locally now generates an error: <b>Liquid Exception: highlight tag was never closed in...</b>. Apparenty it is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/1401">an issue with the new Jekyll</a>. You can read more about it and the fix here: <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2013-08-09/jekyll-tag-was-never-closed/">Jekyll bug: Tag was never closed</a>.</p>
<p><b>tl;dr</b>: Add the line <b>excerpt_separator: ""</b> to your config file (_config.yml)</p>
