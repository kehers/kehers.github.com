<p>So I have been toying with a twitter mobile client in Java. I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/simonpk/j2me-oauth">j2me-oauth library</a> to perform authentication, sign requests and the all the oAuth ish. Everything seems to be working perfectly except that tweeting fails occasionally, returning 401 Unauthorized error. It's clear from the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/error-codes-responses">dev docs</a> that it is an authentication credential problem and most likely has to do with the oauth signature. I spent some time debugging how the library performs the oauth signing and noticed the encoding of some characters are skipped. The encoding should actually include all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. with ~ converted to %7E.</p>
<p>My simple workaround is replacing the <tt>unreservedCharacters</tt> in <tt>net.oauth.j2me.OAuthParameterEncoder</tt> with</p>
<p>{% highlight java linenos %}
//private String unreservedCharacters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-._~";<br />private String unreservedCharacters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-._";
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>and comment out some lines in <tt>net.oauth.j2me.Util</tt></p>
<p>{% highlight java linenos %}
    } else if (
        // safe characters
        c == '-'
        || c == '_'
        || c == '.'
        //|| c == '!'
        //|| c == '~'
        //|| c == '*'
        //|| c == '\''
        //|| c == '('
        //|| c == ')'
        || (c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z')
        || (c &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z') ) {
{% endhighlight %}</p>
