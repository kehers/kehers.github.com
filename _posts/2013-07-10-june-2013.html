<p>Pheew...I have been too lazy to make posts of late. 10 days later, I remember I have to do a dev roundup for June. Oh, well, this will be short.</p>

<p>Between Friday 12th and Sunday 14th, I was privileged to join some great folks to build a blood donation web app. The simple idea is to get a database of blood donors and easily notify them when there is a need around them. The 3 days wasn't enough though. Well, you know, hackathons are not always as easiy as they seem. But we delivered. Did I have fun? Yes! Met new interesting geeks! Def! There are still things to be tidied though and I'm looking forward to that when I have some free time.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="{% post_url 2013-03-31-march-2013 %}">Callpolls</a>? There has been interesting progress. And no, not the new domain or number. But watchout, something interesting in the offing.</p>

<p>Twitter deprecated their version 1.0 API and <a href="http://blog.twhii.com/post/53009579088/new-twhii-update-v1-0a">users started asking questions</a>. Some even mailed. So I did a some updates <a href="http://twhii.com/changelog">(1.0.27 (1.0a) and >)</a> and redesigned the Twhii website.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://prowork.com/">Prowork</a></b></p>
<p>We finally pushed up new design <a href="http://blog.prowork.me/post/53190531304/brand-new-prowork-is-coming-june-18">(v3)</a>. I also made some minor changes to the API.</p>

<p>I think that's about it. Well, the ones I remember and can share.</p>
