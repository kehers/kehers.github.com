Saw this interesting checklist on HN just now on if to sell a side project or not:

> [ ] I don't need money   
> [ ] It's fun to work on this   
> [ ] I have and will have time for this   
>
> 2 checks or more: keep it. 1 check or less: sell it.

Funny but makes sense. By the way, here is a link to the discussion: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7553879>
