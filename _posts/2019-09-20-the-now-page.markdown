I have been thinking of mindful journaling of late. I'll guess it's a subconscious result of ideas I've seen across different places in the last couple of months–a question based social network (you get regular general question prompts), [Cactus](https://cactus.app/), and **Now** pages on some personal blogs.

I redesigned my [blog](http://obem.be/opeyemi) about 2 weeks ago and decided to add a Now page. Then it stuck. Imagine a simple way to publish what I am currently up to (or some sort of journal), but with some social built around it. I can almost hear you scream that's Tumblr/Facebook/Twitter…but this is different.

A [now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) shows a single post about what you are up to. It's not a series of blog posts or series of status updates. And this is the base I fleshed the idea on. At every point, it will only be a single post updated with recent events. A new post overwrites your last public post. (In reality, all your previous posts are archived so you can still have private access to them). The caveat I have also added is that you can set how frequent you want to publish this–once daily, every 3 days or weekly. The goal here is to change preconceived "another blogging/status update site" bias. Once you make a post, you have to wait that interval before you can make a new post. (In reality, you can delete your last post or update your frequency and that will allow you post immediately).

Yes I mentioned social but you can loosely translate that to mean following pages you are interested in so that updates from them become available in your dashboard feed. The caveat: no public display of the following/follower counts. The numbers are only available to you. No commenting, rating or any of those things.

I spent some free time in the last couple of days to build a prototype you can check out at [thenow.page](https://thenow.page/). (I used Twitter for authentication because it's a quick way to get data for quick profiles). Play around, write some stuff and publish your "now”. It's a quick prototype so things may break here and there but I am happy to get the feedback and hear your thoughts. I am [@kehers](https://twitter.com/kehers) on twitter.
