I had to travel to Abuja some weeks ago. Knowing that Tiketmobile has since re-launched as an airport cab booking platform, I decided to give it a shot.

Interestingly, the process was quick and straight to the point. I selected the arriving airport, destination area and arrival time; then signed up and made [online] payment. My driver called me just as I switched on my phone on arrival. He was already waiting outside by the time I cleared my bags. The long ride was smooth and we chatted about random stuff.

I must say I'm really impressed by the service. It saved me the wait time and the hassle of negotiating with the numerous drivers there at the airport. It is only available in Abuja and Port-Harcourt though. I'd like to see more airports - Lagos as one. Getting cabs from that Lagos airport can be tricky. Plus there is the part of worrying about security.
