<p>Here is an experiment to see if writing down a goal in any way helps in achieving it. I have set these for August:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate to Linux (Ubuntu) locally. (May not be fully though)</li>
<li>Learn Ruby</li>
<li>Get better at my guitar (and do a cover song :)) </li>
<li>Finish <a href="http://10api.posterous.com/">Around the Web in 10 APIs</a> (the local copy)</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is replicated everywhere I will come across it reguarly as well - writing pad, mobile and sticky notes on PC. At the end of the 31 days, I want to see how far I have gone.</p>
