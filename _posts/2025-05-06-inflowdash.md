I have been using an internal tool for some time now to check upcoming revenue for [Engage](https://engage.so/). It connects to Stripe, pulls data for upcoming revenue and displays it in a calendar form. That's it; nothing magical. This tool is now available at [inflowdash.com](https://inflowdash.com/)

## Why?

Current metrics dashboards are focused on data after the fact (after revenue is in). This is rightly so as they tell a story of growth. For inflowdash, it is the other way - data before the fact, which is perfect for forecasting. This helps:

- Forecast and plan cash flow
- Identify problems early
- Manage churn and expansion revenue
- Set accurate goals

If you do usage billing (like we do), where pricing is based on usage and not particularly fixed, this is even more accurate.
