<p>I have been using this IDE and I'm marvelled at the simple important things that were left out of the editor. So, I decided to make a list of the things that should make up a simple minimalistic editor, from my own perspective, as a developer.<p /><strong>The core</strong><br />Really, this is all you need to have in an editor. If you miss any of these, you don't have an editor yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting/Code coloring</li>
<li>Line numbering</li>
<li>Auto indenting</li>
<li>Word wrap</li>
<li>Code block collapsing</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>The forgivables</strong><br />Your editor can have these but if you miss any of it, you are forgivable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto complete (depends on your target programming language. For a general editor you must have html, css and some basic C methods in there)</li>
<li>Multiple file tabs</li>
<li>File explorer sidebar</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Overkill</strong><br />Want to take one step further? Just these other two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple views (different or same file in like two views in same window)</li>
<li>Themes (or style customization)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />That does it for me. Now, your turn. What makes a simple editor to you?</p>
