I got this dm last night: "You seen what this person is saying about <br />you? <a href="http://t.co/yGEpkCu">http://t.co/yGEpkCu</a> terrible things.." from a friend. The message <br />looked weird but out of curiosity, I checked out the link (via mobile) <br />and noticed I was directed to a twitter login page where I am to <br />provide my username and password. Checking out the address, I noticed <br />the root domain of the url was <a href="http://tivvitter.com/">http://tivvitter.com/</a> (notice how close <br />that looks to twitter.com). Sites like this have only one purpose. <br />Collect your username and password to use your account for <br />unscrupulous acts - post ads, scam your friends/followers and even <br />knock you out. But it goes even beyond twitter. Users should be <br />careful of links directing them to sites requiring them to login their <br />credentials. Double check the url and be sure it is the real domain <br />name of the service or web app.
