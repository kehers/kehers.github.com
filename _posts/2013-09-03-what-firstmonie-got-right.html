<p>I spent some minutes checking First Bank's mobile money service, <a href="http://www.firstmonieonline.com/">Firstmonie</a>, over the the weekend. I'm yet to register though, but I see myself using the service. Okay, I may not find the need but I'm impressed by a couple of things. (As seen on the site)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Platforms</b><br />
The service is available on web, mobile apps (on the major platforms), and USSD (*894#). It is therefore easy to get started from your comfort zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>ATM funding</b><br />
I like the fact that you can fund your account with your ATM card (not necessarily First Bank's) from [their] ATM. You are not restricted to funding via internet or agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Account linking</b><br />
You can link your mobile money account to your [First] bank account. This means you can easily transfer cash between the accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Easy pay out and cash withdrawal</b><br />
This is my fav. When you send money to someone, the person can easily make a cardless withdrawal from any First Bank ATM. He/she doesn't need to have a Firstmonie account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
