<p>I skipped last month. Well, there was nothing notable to share. Most things I worked on were private things. Same with May. But May was more fun - Mobile Web West Africa, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ZOK88aP7Qd/">a free* Nokia Asha 310</a>, more travelling and a hardcore pitch.</p>

<p>But majorly, I have been working on <a href="http://blog.prowork.me/post/53190531304/brand-new-prowork-is-coming-june-18">a new version of Prowork</a>. The new version features some subtle interface change (this is more profound in the project page), more features and speed. (I am a sucker for speed).</p>

<p>Oh, and I remember, I also wrote a jquery plugin: <a href="{% post_url 2013-05-06-jquery.listSort.js %}">ListSort</a>.</p>
